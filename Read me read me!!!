As of now, this code can preform simple questions and actions such as printing a wall of text, 
asking a person if they wish to continue a game and where they want to go


Unfortunately, poor time management and understanding of code has lead to my inability to finish this project in time. The most difficult thing that presented itself
during this project was the map system, even when I found a good method online (https://benhoyt.com/writings/hash-table-in-c/) I couldn't use it due to misunderstanding
code. Even after finding another solution, other coding problems continued to block my path. Warnings with seemingly no sense continued to present themselves. While
the finished project itself is a sorry sight I moderately enjoy the effort clearly seen within the code. Over my time within the class I can see improvement in my
ability to slightly understand code and how to implement it.
